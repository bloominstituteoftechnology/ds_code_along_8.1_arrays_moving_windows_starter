def solution(size):
    # your code here
    return "hello world"


# Create a square 2D array (list type in Python) of size size x size. Fill the array with 0's.
# Then draw a line of 1's down the main diagonal.
# This is called an identity matrix.

# Example
# Input: size = 4
# Output: solution(4) =
# [
#     [1, 0, 0, 0],
#     [0, 1, 0, 0],
#     [0, 0, 1, 0],
#     [0, 0, 0, 1]
