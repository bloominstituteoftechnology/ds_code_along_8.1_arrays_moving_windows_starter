def solution(a, window_size):
    # your code here
    return "hello world"

# Write a function that moves a "window" over an array, averaging the values under the window as it goes.

# For example, a window of size 3 moving across an array of length 9 might look like this for the first 3 moves (window is the bar over the values):

#  _____
#  6 2 8 3 7 9 1 0 5    Window over 6,2,8

#    _____
#  6 2 8 3 7 9 1 0 5    Window over 2,8,3

#      _____
#  6 2 8 3 7 9 1 0 5    Window over 8,3,7
# Your goal is to return an array of averages of the values under the window as it moves.

# Example
# Input:

# a == [20, 64, 73, 58, 74]
# window_size == 4
# Output:

# [53.75, 67.25]
